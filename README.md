# easyFlow
Small experiment I made using AI to organize messy information into structured action items and summaries

The program is easy, and simple. a Prototype project that explores how AI can reduce operational fragmentation.
I used something similar when Teams often tracked action items across meetings, emails, and documents.  
This would create a hidden work and missed commitments.
This experiment converts unstructured meeting notes into structured action items with ownership.
given a set of notes, the program would give you 
Raw meeting notes → extracted tasks → structured workflow objects
the  goal was to simulate automation tools used in operations, integration, and project management environments.
